# Automated Orchestra for Uffruhr

## Setup

- Download this Git Repo
- Open config.json; paste in a working OpenAI API key, specify the output JSON file that should have the parameters written to it, the MIDI device name (probably LoopMIDI on Windows, IAC on Mac), and the appropriate port/ip for the TCP connection.
- Run `client.py`, e.g through Thonny
